For example, this is what it would look like Project 145, Beatboxes by Zeblocks:

- Project Title: "Beatboxes"
- Project ID: 145
- Artist Channel ID: 800761846235136020
- Project Keyword: "beatbox"

Note: you can find the channel ID for a given channel by right-clicking it in Discord and selecting "Copy ID".

Also note that Playground projects need a project keyword so that ArtBot knows that the user is intending to trigger the bot for a given Playground project vs. the artist's first Curated project, which is the default.
