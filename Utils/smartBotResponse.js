If you want your transaction to be approved more quickly, you can increase this to be higher than [the going rate](https://www.gasnow.org/) in order to incentivize miners to process your transaction over other pending transactions.\n\nThe gas _limit_ is the total amount of gas that you are willing to allow your transaction to consume. This amount is auto-magically estimated by MetaMask based on the complexity of the transaction you are performing. Unless you are an expert, you should **never** modify this value. Increasing the gas limit will have no impact on the priority of your transaction, while decreasing it may result in your transaction failing due to "running out of gas" and you losing a transaction fee in the process.`,
